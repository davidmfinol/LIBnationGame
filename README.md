LIBnationGame
=============
The Original Fighting Game.
Made in my freshman year of high school, this game was the first step in my game development career.
Mossflower (represented by the mouse) is my online username, and Nick (represented by Mega-Man) was another member of the now defunct LIBnation community.

Run
-------------
Java applets have been deprecated by modern web browsers, so this java applet has been configured to launch through JNLP.
To run, add "file:///" to your java security exceptions, as described here: https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml.
Double-click on LIBnationGame.jnlp to launch it. Ignore security warnings.
You can open LIBnationGame.html in your web browser to see the controls. 

Build
-------------
The compiled version is already included, so building is not necessary. 
If you would like to rebuild anyway: Compile java classes, create jar file, and sign the jar.

Windows: 
Running the build.bat should work assuming you have your java classpath correctly set and you have a "DavidFinolWaterford" alias in your default java keystore.
