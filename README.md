LIBnationGame
=============
The Original Fighting Game.
Made in my freshman year of high school, this game was the first step in my game development career.
Mossflower (represented by the mouse) is my online username, and Nick (represented by Mega-Man) was another member of the now defunct LIBnation community.


Build
-------------
Windows: 
Running the build.bat should work if you have your java classpath correctly set.

Otherwise: 
Compile java classes, create jar file, and sign the jar.

Run
-------------
Java applets have been deprecated by modern web browsers, so this java applet has been configured to launch through JNLP.
You can open LIBnationGame.html in your web browser so that you can see the controls. You can also just launch LIBnationGame.jnlp.
